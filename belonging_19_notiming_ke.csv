WITH REGARDS TO THE ARCHITECTURE: THE ARCHITECTURE IS UNIQUE WHEN COMPARED TO JUST THE SURROUNDING AREAS IN PITTSBURGH. FOR EXAMPLE(comma) THE ELABORATE ARCHES ATOP OF TREES HALL DEFINITELY STANDS OUT FROM THE HOUSES THAT ARE ACROSS THE ROAD. ALSO(comma) THE CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING IS MASSIVE: I THINK IT'S FAIR TO ASSUME THAT MOST INCOMING STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SUCH A LARGE BUILDING. IN ADDITION(comma) THE ARCHITECTURE IS PROBABLY DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHERE INCOMING STUDENTS PROBABLY COME FROM. I LIVED IN BUTLER COUNTY BEFORE COMING TO PITTSBURGH(comma) AND(comma) EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY CLOSE(comma) I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY ARCHITECTURE IN BUTLER COUNTY THAT RESEMBLES THE ARCHITECTURE OF PITT.
AS FOR THE WEATHER: AGAIN I LIVED IN BUTLER COUNTY(comma) SO PITTSBURGH SHARES A LOT OF WEATHER PATTERNS WITH MY FORMER HOME; THEREFORE(comma) ACCLIMATING TO THE WEATHER WASN'T A HUGE TASK. HOWEVER(comma) NOT EVERYONE COMES FROM BUTLER COUNTY. JUST FROM MY FLOOR ALONE(comma) THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO PITT FROM BRAZIL(comma) THE UK(comma) CHINA(comma) SOUTH KOREA(comma) AND JAPAN. I'VE BEEN TO BRAZIL AND THE UK FOR FAMILY VACATIONS(comma) AND THE HARDEST PART OF THOSE VACATIONS WAS PLANNING AROUND UNFAMILIAR WEATHER; LIKEWISE(comma) IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THE STUDENTS COMING FROM THESE COUNTRIES (OR JUST FROM A DIFFERENT REGION OF THE COUNTRY) WOULD STRUGGLE AROUND THE WEATHER AT FIRST.
ALTHOUGH REACTIONS TO THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AT PITT ARE STRONG AT FIRST(comma) THEY DO TEND TO DULL DOWN OVER TIME. I CAN THINK OF TWO REASONS WHY. THE FIRST IS JUST BEING EXPOSED TO IT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. FOR EXAMPLE(comma) MY DAD IS A PROUD PITT ALUMNUS THAT ALWAYS SHOWED OFF THE ARCHITECTURE OF CAMPUS WHEN WE CAME TO A BASKETBALL GAME(comma) SO WHEN I ARRIVED ON CAMPUS I ALREADY SAW A LARGE CHUNK OF THE CAMPUS. THIS MEANT THAT WHEN I ARRIVED ON CAMPUS(comma) I WASN'T OVERWHELMED WITH SHOCK BY SEEING THE IMPRESSIVE ARCHITECTURE SINCE I HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED TO IT. THE SAME CAN BE SAID WITH THE WEATHER SINCE I LIVED IN BUTLER COUNTY. THE SECOND REASON IS CLASS. AT THE TIME I AM WRITING THIS(comma) CLASSES HAVE NOT STARTED(comma) BUT I THEORIZE THAT ONCE CLASS STARTS(comma) THE WEATHER AND ARCHITECTURE WOULD BE THROWN ASIDE IN FAVOR OF STUDYING AND WORRYING ABOUT THE EXAM ON THE HORIZON. THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME: RIGHT NOW I HAVE AN AMAZING VIEW OF THE CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING FROM MY DORM IN NORDENBERG(comma) BUT RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THAT I AM FOCUSING ON THIS ESSAY.  
OVERALL(comma) PITT'S UNIQUENESS IN ARCHITECTURE AND WEATHER MAKE ADJUSTMENTS DIFFICULT AT FIRST(comma) BUT ONCE INCOMING STUDENTS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND CLASSES HAVE BEGUN(comma) STUDENTS WILL FIND COMFORT IN THE UNIQUENESS OF THE CAMPUS IN WHICH THEY RESIDE., ,2,5,7,7,1,2,1(comma)3(comma)4(comma)5, ,2,3,4,3,2,3,3,4,2,1,1,3,2,3,4,7,7,7,4,6,6,1(comma)2,7,4,2,2,3,5,4,2,1,1,NA, ,1,I LEARNED THAT PEOPLE NEED TIME TO GET USED TO THE AREA AND TIME TO ACCLIMATE TO THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM.

I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT IN REGARDS TO FITTING IN(comma) BECAUSE I HAD GROWN UP WITH MOST OF THESE PEOPLE AND I HAD A CORE GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT FOLLOWED ME THROUGH THE GRADES(comma) SO I KNEW I?D HAVE FAMILIAR FACES AROUND. I?VE ONLY BEEN TO PITTSBURGH TWICE- BOTH TIMES VISITING PITT- AND I?M UNFAMILIAR WITH THE AREA AND THE PEOPLE. I KNOW PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND WORLD WILL BE JOINING MY CLASS THIS YEAR(comma) AND I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT TO EXPECT. I DON?T KNOW IF MY EDUCATION TO THIS POINT HAS PREPARED ME ENOUGH TO BE SUCCESSFUL COMPARED TO MY PEERS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I DON?T HAVE A CORE GROUP OF FRIENDS WHO ARE GOING INTO THIS NEW SCHOOL WITH ME. I?M WORRIED ABOUT FITTING IN AND BELONGING BECAUSE I TRULY DON?T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND I SOMETIMES WONDER IF I?VE GROWN UP ENOUGH TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE ALL BY MYSELF. THESE WORRIES ARE MOST LIKELY COMMON FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS LIKE ME BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING IN WITH CLOSE FRIENDS AND THEY PROBABLY ALSO QUESTION THEMSELVES AND IF THEY?VE BEEN ADEQUATELY PREPARED FOR SUCH A GOOD UNIVERSITY. I THINK STUDENTS TYPICALLY FEEL MORE AT HOME ON THE CAMPUS WITH TIME BECAUSE EVENTUALLY YOU GET USED TO THE BUILDINGS AND STREETS. YOU KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND CAMPUS USING THE FASTEST ROUTES AND YOU?VE BECOME COMFORTABLE USING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. PEOPLE ALSO PROBABLY MAKE SOME FRIENDS TO STICK WITH AS THE YEAR GOES ON(comma) SO IT?S EASIER TO GO AROUND THE CAMPUS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. A LOT OF PEOPLE ALSO PROBABLY NEED TIME TO ADJUST TO DORM LIVING AND SHARING A SMALL SPACE WITH SOMEONE ELSE(comma) WHO THEY DON?T KNOW INITIALLY. I KNOW PERSONALLY I?M WORRIED BECAUSE I?VE NEVER LIVED IN A CITY AND I AM NERVOUS ABOUT MY NAVIGATIONAL SKILLS. IT ALSO MAKES ME ANXIOUS THINKING ABOUT USING THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO PLACES OUTSIDE OF CAMPUS BECAUSE I?M NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT. I?VE ALSO NEVER SHARED MY SPACE WITH SOMEONE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME(comma) AND I DON?T KNOW MY ROOMMATE AT ALL(comma) SO I WORRY THAT IT WON?T GO SMOOTHLY. DURING THE SUMMER OF 2018(comma) I PARTICIPATED IN A NATIONAL YOUTH LEADERSHIP FORUM CALLED ENVISION FOR MEDICINE THAT LASTED NINE DAYS. I HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE- I HAD NEVER EVEN PARTICIPATED IN ANY TYPE OF SLEEP AWAY CAMP. I WAS INCREDIBLY ANXIOUS(comma) BUT LUCKILY THE EXPERIENCE WAS AMAZING. EVERYONE STARTED OUT AS STRANGERS- COMING FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WITH ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS- BUT BY THE END WE WERE SO CLOSE. I HAD A ROOMMATE THERE WHO I BONDED WITH EASILY AND MADE A LOT OF GREAT FRIENDS. THAT EXPERIENCE HAS DEFINITELY HELPED ME TO BE LESS ANXIOUS ABOUT STARTING AT PITT BECAUSE ENVISION WAS A WHOLE NEW ENVIRONMENT FILLED WITH PEOPLE I DIDN?T KNOW THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO SOME OF THE GREATEST EXPERIENCES I?VE EVER HAD AND BEST PEOPLE I?VE EVER MET. IT HELPED ME BE MORE CONFIDENT IN MYSELF AND MY ABILITY TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS AND ADJUST TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS. I APPRECIATE THE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT GAVE ME A GLIMPSE OF WHAT COLLEGE LIFE WILL BE LIKE. I THINK STUDENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE FAMILIARITY WITH THE CAMPUS IN ORDER TO FEEL MORE AT HOME.
